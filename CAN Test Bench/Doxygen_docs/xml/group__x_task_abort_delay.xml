<para>INCLUDE_xTaskAbortDelay must be defined as 1 in <ref refid="_free_r_t_o_s_config_8h" kindref="compound">FreeRTOSConfig.h</ref> for this function to be available.</para>
<para>A task will enter the Blocked state when it is waiting for an event. The event it is waiting for can be a temporal event (waiting for a time), such as when <ref refid="task_8h_1aa154068cecd7f31446a7a84af44ab1a3" kindref="member">vTaskDelay()</ref> is called, or an event on an object, such as when <ref refid="queue_8h_1ae8364d988c6f9b63c771cc2b3dfe5df9" kindref="member">xQueueReceive()</ref> or <ref refid="task_8h_1a66540bef602522a01a519f776e4c07d8" kindref="member">ulTaskNotifyTake()</ref> is called. If the handle of a task that is in the Blocked state is used in a call to <ref refid="task_8h_1afefe333df0492c8411c0094badd25185" kindref="member">xTaskAbortDelay()</ref> then the task will leave the Blocked state, and return from whichever function call placed the task into the Blocked state.</para>
<para>There is no &apos;FromISR&apos; version of this function as an interrupt would need to know which object a task was blocked on in order to know which actions to take. For example, if the task was blocked on a queue the interrupt handler would then need to know if the queue was locked.</para>
