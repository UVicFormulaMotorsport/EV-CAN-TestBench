Arguments for the driving loop. The reason this is a struct passed in as an argument, rather than a bunch of global variables or constants is to allow the code to take settings from flash memory, therefore allowing the team to meet it\textquotesingle{}s goal of having an actual G\+UI to change vehicle settings.
