Creates a new stream buffer using dynamically allocated memory. See \mbox{\hyperlink{stream__buffer_8h_a3c248575ac1b83801db605b32a118f77}{x\+Stream\+Buffer\+Create\+Static()}} for a version that uses statically allocated memory (memory that is allocated at compile time).

\begin{DoxyParams}{Parameters}
{\em x\+Buffer\+Size\+Bytes} & The total number of bytes the stream buffer will be able to hold at any one time.\\
\hline
{\em x\+Trigger\+Level\+Bytes} & The number of bytes that must be in the stream buffer before a task that is blocked on the stream buffer to wait for data is moved out of the blocked state. For example, if a task is blocked on a read of an empty stream buffer that has a trigger level of 1 then the task will be unblocked when a single byte is written to the buffer or the task\textquotesingle{}s block time expires. As another example, if a task is blocked on a read of an empty stream buffer that has a trigger level of 10 then the task will not be unblocked until the stream buffer contains at least 10 bytes or the task\textquotesingle{}s block time expires. If a reading task\textquotesingle{}s block time expires before the trigger level is reached then the task will still receive however many bytes are actually available. Setting a trigger level of 0 will result in a trigger level of 1 being used. It is not valid to specify a trigger level that is greater than the buffer size.\\
\hline
\end{DoxyParams}
\begin{DoxyReturn}{Returns}
If N\+U\+LL is returned, then the stream buffer cannot be created because there is insufficient heap memory available for Free\+R\+T\+OS to allocate the stream buffer data structures and storage area. A non-\/\+N\+U\+LL value being returned indicates that the stream buffer has been created successfully -\/ the returned value should be stored as the handle to the created stream buffer.
