Events can be sent to a task using an intermediary object. Examples of such objects are queues, semaphores, mutexes and event groups. Task notifications are a method of sending an event directly to a task without the need for such an intermediary object.

A notification sent to a task can optionally perform an action, such as update, overwrite or increment the task\textquotesingle{}s notification value. In that way task notifications can be used to send data to a task, or be used as light weight and fast binary or counting semaphores.

A notification sent to a task will remain pending until it is cleared by the task calling \mbox{\hyperlink{task_8h_a0475fcda9718f403521c270a7270ff93}{x\+Task\+Notify\+Wait()}} or \mbox{\hyperlink{task_8h_a66540bef602522a01a519f776e4c07d8}{ul\+Task\+Notify\+Take()}}. If the task was already in the Blocked state to wait for a notification when the notification arrives then the task will automatically be removed from the Blocked state (unblocked) and the notification cleared.

A task can use \mbox{\hyperlink{task_8h_a0475fcda9718f403521c270a7270ff93}{x\+Task\+Notify\+Wait()}} to \mbox{[}optionally\mbox{]} block to wait for a notification to be pending, or \mbox{\hyperlink{task_8h_a66540bef602522a01a519f776e4c07d8}{ul\+Task\+Notify\+Take()}} to \mbox{[}optionally\mbox{]} block to wait for its notification value to have a non-\/zero value. The task does not consume any C\+PU time while it is in the Blocked state.

\begin{DoxyParams}{Parameters}
{\em x\+Task\+To\+Notify} & The handle of the task being notified. The handle to a task can be returned from the x\+Task\+Create() A\+PI function used to create the task, and the handle of the currently running task can be obtained by calling \mbox{\hyperlink{task_8h_a85a0f9c9f817b18686efbf8f37c72dfc}{x\+Task\+Get\+Current\+Task\+Handle()}}.\\
\hline
{\em ul\+Value} & Data that can be sent with the notification. How the data is used depends on the value of the e\+Action parameter.\\
\hline
{\em e\+Action} & Specifies how the notification updates the task\textquotesingle{}s notification value, if at all. Valid values for e\+Action are as follows\+:\\

\end{DoxyParams}
e\+Set\+Bits -\/ The task\textquotesingle{}s notification value is bitwise O\+Red with ul\+Value. x\+Task\+Nofify() always returns pd\+P\+A\+SS in this case.

e\+Increment -\/ The task\textquotesingle{}s notification value is incremented. ul\+Value is not used and \mbox{\hyperlink{task_8h_a0d2d54fb8a64011dfbb54983e4ed06bd}{x\+Task\+Notify()}} always returns pd\+P\+A\+SS in this case.

e\+Set\+Value\+With\+Overwrite -\/ The task\textquotesingle{}s notification value is set to the value of ul\+Value, even if the task being notified had not yet processed the previous notification (the task already had a notification pending). \mbox{\hyperlink{task_8h_a0d2d54fb8a64011dfbb54983e4ed06bd}{x\+Task\+Notify()}} always returns pd\+P\+A\+SS in this case.

e\+Set\+Value\+Without\+Overwrite -\/ If the task being notified did not already have a notification pending then the task\textquotesingle{}s notification value is set to ul\+Value and \mbox{\hyperlink{task_8h_a0d2d54fb8a64011dfbb54983e4ed06bd}{x\+Task\+Notify()}} will return pd\+P\+A\+SS. If the task being notified already had a notification pending then no action is performed and pd\+F\+A\+IL is returned.

e\+No\+Action -\/ The task receives a notification without its notification value being updated. ul\+Value is not used and \mbox{\hyperlink{task_8h_a0d2d54fb8a64011dfbb54983e4ed06bd}{x\+Task\+Notify()}} always returns pd\+P\+A\+SS in this case.

pul\+Previous\+Notification\+Value -\/ Can be used to pass out the subject task\textquotesingle{}s notification value before any bits are modified by the notify function.
