BaseType\_t xQueueReceive(
                             QueueHandle\_t xQueue,
                             void *pvBuffer,

Receive an item from a queue. The item is received by copy so a buffer of adequate size must be provided. The number of bytes copied into the buffer was defined when the queue was created.

Successfully received items are removed from the queue.

This function must not be used in an interrupt service routine. See x\+Queue\+Receive\+From\+I\+SR for an alternative that can.


\begin{DoxyParams}{Parameters}
{\em x\+Queue} & The handle to the queue from which the item is to be received.\\
\hline
{\em pv\+Buffer} & Pointer to the buffer into which the received item will be copied.\\
\hline
{\em x\+Ticks\+To\+Wait} & The maximum amount of time the task should block waiting for an item to receive should the queue be empty at the time of the call. \mbox{\hyperlink{queue_8h_ae8364d988c6f9b63c771cc2b3dfe5df9}{x\+Queue\+Receive()}} will return immediately if x\+Ticks\+To\+Wait is zero and the queue is empty. The time is defined in tick periods so the constant port\+T\+I\+C\+K\+\_\+\+P\+E\+R\+I\+O\+D\+\_\+\+MS should be used to convert to real time if this is required.\\
\hline
\end{DoxyParams}
\begin{DoxyReturn}{Returns}
pd\+T\+R\+UE if an item was successfully received from the queue, otherwise pd\+F\+A\+L\+SE.
\end{DoxyReturn}

\begin{DoxyPre}
struct AMessage

\begin{DoxyPre}   // Create a queue capable of containing 10 pointers to AMessage structures.
   // These should be passed by pointer as they contain a lot of data.

\begin{DoxyPre}   // Send a pointer to a struct AMessage object.  Don't block if the
   // queue is already full.
   pxMessage = \& xMessage;
   xQueueSend( xQueue, ( void * ) \&pxMessage, ( TickType\_t ) 0 );\end{DoxyPre}

\begin{DoxyPre}// Task to receive from the queue.

\begin{DoxyPre}   if( xQueue != 0 )
   \{
    // Receive a message on the created queue.  Block for 10 ticks if a
    // message is not immediately available.
    if( xQueueReceive( xQueue, \&( pxRxedMessage ), ( TickType\_t ) 10 ) )

        // by vATask.
