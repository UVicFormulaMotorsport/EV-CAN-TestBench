Determines if px\+Ticks\+To\+Wait ticks has passed since a time was captured using a call to \mbox{\hyperlink{task_8h_a67155ad4ea2482b5f4597a69f2152be0}{v\+Task\+Set\+Time\+Out\+State()}}. The captured time includes the tick count and the number of times the tick count has overflowed.


\begin{DoxyParams}{Parameters}
{\em px\+Time\+Out} & The time status as captured previously using v\+Task\+Set\+Time\+Out\+State. If the timeout has not yet occurred, it is updated to reflect the current time status. \\
\hline
{\em px\+Ticks\+To\+Wait} & The number of ticks to check for timeout i.\+e. if px\+Ticks\+To\+Wait ticks have passed since px\+Time\+Out was last updated (either by \mbox{\hyperlink{task_8h_a67155ad4ea2482b5f4597a69f2152be0}{v\+Task\+Set\+Time\+Out\+State()}} or \mbox{\hyperlink{task_8h_a3b018a85d339e536a6c05748dd666a3a}{x\+Task\+Check\+For\+Time\+Out()}}), the timeout has occurred. If the timeout has not occurred, px\+T\+Icks\+To\+Wait is updated to reflect the number of remaining ticks.\\
\hline
\end{DoxyParams}
\begin{DoxyReturn}{Returns}
If timeout has occurred, pd\+T\+R\+UE is returned. Otherwise pd\+F\+A\+L\+SE is returned and px\+Ticks\+To\+Wait is updated to reflect the number of remaining ticks.

   // more data has been placed into the buffer. If there is still not enough
   // data then the task re-\/enters the Blocked state, and \mbox{\hyperlink{task_8h_a3b018a85d339e536a6c05748dd666a3a}{xTaskCheckForTimeOut()}}
   // is used to re-\/calculate the Block time to ensure the total amount of time
   // spent in the Blocked state does not exceed MAX\_TIME\_TO\_WAIT. This
   // continues until either the buffer contains at least uxWantedBytes bytes,
   // or the total amount of time spent in the Blocked state reaches
   // MAX\_TIME\_TO\_WAIT â€“ at which point the task reads however many bytes are
   // available up to a maximum of uxWantedBytes.\end{DoxyPre}
