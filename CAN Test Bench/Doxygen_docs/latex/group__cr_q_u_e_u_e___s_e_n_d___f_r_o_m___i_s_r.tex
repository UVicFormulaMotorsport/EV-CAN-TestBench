cr\+Q\+U\+E\+U\+E\+\_\+\+S\+E\+N\+D\+\_\+\+F\+R\+O\+M\+\_\+\+I\+SR can only be called from an I\+SR to send data to a queue that is being used from within a co-\/routine.

See the co-\/routine section of the W\+EB documentation for information on passing data between tasks and co-\/routines and between I\+SR\textquotesingle{}s and co-\/routines.


\begin{DoxyParams}{Parameters}
{\em x\+Queue} & The handle to the queue on which the item is to be posted.\\
\hline
{\em pv\+Item\+To\+Queue} & A pointer to the item that is to be placed on the queue. The size of the items the queue will hold was defined when the queue was created, so this many bytes will be copied from pv\+Item\+To\+Queue into the queue storage area.\\
\hline
{\em x\+Co\+Routine\+Previously\+Woken} & This is included so an I\+SR can post onto the same queue multiple times from a single interrupt. The first call should always pass in pd\+F\+A\+L\+SE. Subsequent calls should pass in the value returned from the previous call.\\
\hline
\end{DoxyParams}
\begin{DoxyReturn}{Returns}
pd\+T\+R\+UE if a co-\/routine was woken by posting onto the queue. This is used by the I\+SR to determine if a context switch may be required following the I\+SR.
\end{DoxyReturn}
