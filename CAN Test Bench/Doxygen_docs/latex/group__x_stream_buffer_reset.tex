Resets a stream buffer to its initial, empty, state. Any data that was in the stream buffer is discarded. A stream buffer can only be reset if there are no tasks blocked waiting to either send to or receive from the stream buffer.


\begin{DoxyParams}{Parameters}
{\em x\+Stream\+Buffer} & The handle of the stream buffer being reset.\\

\begin{DoxyReturn}{Returns}
If the stream buffer is reset then pd\+P\+A\+SS is returned. If there was a task blocked waiting to send to or read from the stream buffer then the stream buffer is not reset and pd\+F\+A\+IL is returned.
